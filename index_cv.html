                    <h5>During secondary school, I did IT for GCSE. Then during A-levels, I did
                        Mathematics, as well as Physics. As I progressed, I started to wonder where I would excel with
                        my set of skills.</h5>

                    <h6>I am hard-working, and organised. I can make a good and fair leader within a team, and I am
                        happy working under a leader as well. I am very creative; I have grown up with an immense
                        imagination, helping me to create stories which I reside in as a safe-place.</h6>

                    <div class="finalpara">
                        As I reflected on my skills and education, I thought about taking up a course in Computing.
                        And it was not just due to myself, but also the future - the world is entering a computerised
                        era very fast. And with this, I chose Computing at the University of Northampton. Because of
                        all this reflection and thinking, because of the paths that I chose, I was able to
                        cretae this website. And now you - The Viewer - are here, appreciating (or maybe dispising) 
                        my work... Whatever the case, You are still here. Everything leads to a positive in the end.
